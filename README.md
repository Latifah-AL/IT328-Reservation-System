# Online Restaurant Reservation System

This project was developed as part of the **IT328 – Network Principles** course.

The system simulates a real-world restaurant reservation platform, allowing multiple clients to interact with the restaurant system in real time. Its primary goal is to **implement networking, concurrency, and GUI concepts** in Java to manage reservations efficiently.

## Project Overview

The Online Restaurant Reservation System is a **Java-based application** demonstrating how sockets, multithreading, and object-oriented programming can be applied to build a functional client-server system. The system handles:

- **User Management:** Register new users and connect to the server.  
- **Reservation Management:** Make, confirm, update, or cancel reservations.  
- **Availability Tracking:** Monitor and update table availability in real time.  
- **Concurrency Handling:** Support multiple clients interacting with the system simultaneously using multithreading.

All major operations include **real-time updates and proper synchronization** to ensure data consistency across concurrent users.

## Technologies Used
- **Java** – Core implementation  
- **Sockets & Networking** – Client-server communication  
- **Multithreading** – Handling multiple clients concurrently  
- **GUI (Swing/JavaFX)** – Interactive user interface  

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in:  
- Implementing **socket-based client-server communication**  
- Handling **concurrent operations** using multithreading  
- Designing **interactive GUIs** for desktop applications  
- Applying **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles  
- Translating **real-world requirements into functional system logic**
